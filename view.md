# View

Using the `app:install` Artisan command you can install the `view` component:

```bash
php <your-app-name> app:install view
```

<a name="usage"></a>
#### Usage

The `View` component allows to render HTML views and take advantage of the blade template engine.

As usual, the usage is similar to Laravel:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;

View::make('view.name', ['foo' => 'bar']);
view('view-name', ['foo' => 'bar']);
```

## Using views in production

In order to use blade view in production, a `view.php` file must be added in `config` directory to specify the path where the compiled view should be stored.

For example:
```php
<?php
return [
    'paths' => [
        resource_path('views'),
    ],

    'compiled' => getcwd() //the working directory of the phar
]
```

You also need to add the `resources` directory in the `box.json` file to include it in the PHAR file will be compiled:
```json
"directories": [
    "app",
    "bootstrap",
    "config",
    "vendor",
    "resources"
],
```

Full details on using the View component is available on the [main Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/views).
